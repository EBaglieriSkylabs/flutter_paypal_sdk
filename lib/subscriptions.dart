/// You can use billing plans and subscriptions to create subscriptions that
/// process recurring PayPal payments for physical or digital goods, or
/// services. A plan includes pricing and billing cycle information that defines
/// the amount and frequency of charge for a subscription. You can also define a
/// fixed plan, such as a $5 basic plan or a volume- or graduated-based plan
/// with pricing tiers based on the quantity purchased. For more information,
